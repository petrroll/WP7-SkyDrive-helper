A simple SkyDrive helper class I've written a few years ago to make backing up stuff from WP7 apps easier. Since the API has changed over the few years quite drastically it probably won't even work now.

Disclaimer: It's build on top of SkyDrive backup sample by Andrew Bares (http://wmpoweruser.com/developers-use-skydrive-to-backup-app-data/)
