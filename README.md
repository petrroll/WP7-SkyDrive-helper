###About:
A simple SkyDrive helper class I've written __a few years ago__ to make backing up stuff from WP7 apps easier. Since the API has changed over the few years quite drastically it __probably won't  work now__ (and I was also a rubish coder back then so good luck understanding it :) ).

__Disclaimer:__ It's build on top of SkyDrive [backup sample by Andrew Bares](http://wmpoweruser.com/developers-use-skydrive-to-backup-app-data/).
